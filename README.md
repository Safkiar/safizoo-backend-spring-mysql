SPRING (JAVA) - ANGULAR - MYSQL - SCSS

SafiZoo is a fullstack e-commerce application where users can browse products, view details, and place orders. The application uses Angular SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for enhanced performance and SEO optimization on the frontend, while Spring Boot serves as the backend API connected to a MySQL database for data storage. Each part of the system (frontend, backend, and database) is hosted individually and communicates seamlessly.
